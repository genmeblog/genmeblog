Hi, Tomasz here, I'm passionate Clojure engineer which specializes mostly in scientific usage of the language. Member of the [Scicloj](https://scicloj.github.io/) community. I do this mostly as a side activity and hobby. My primary professional role involves managing a software house company as CTO/CIO. In the past I used to be a software developer, system analyst, project and program manager.

Currently seeking for an opportunity to switch from managemnt to purely Clojure development.

## Libraries

I've created or contributed to many of the open source projects listed below.

* [tablecloth](https://github.com/scicloj/tablecloth) - dataset manipulation library, unified API on the top of [tech.ml.dataset](https://github.com/techascent/tech.ml.dataset)
* [fastmath](https://github.com/generateme/fastmath) - general mathematics and statistics library (with elements of ML)
* [fitdistr](https://github.com/generateme/fitdistr) - distribution fitting to a data
* [clojisr](https://github.com/scicloj/clojisr) (co-author) - R <-> Clojure bridge
* [wadogo](https://github.com/scicloj/wadogo) - domain -> range (scales) transformations including continous and discrete cases
* [metamorph](https://github.com/scicloj/metamorph) (co-author) - data processing pipelines
* [LBFGSB](https://github.com/genmeblog/LBFGSBJava) - L-BFGS-B optimizer written purely in Java (exposed in fastmath)

On hold
